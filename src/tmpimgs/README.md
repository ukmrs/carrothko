## very temporary storage

The encoded images are briefly saved before being served but then shortly deleted.

This directory should be empty except this overgrown .gitkeep.

The sole purpose of this README was so this dir can be commited to git.
But now it also explains stuff. 
So... That's pretty neat ðŸ¦œ
